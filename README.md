#MY WORK IN THIS TASK .
"I created a wireframe, mockup, and prototype for a Korean school website. The wireframe focused on outlining the basic structure and layout of the site, ensuring it was user-friendly and functional. The mockup added visual elements, including colors, typography, and branding, to reflect the schoolâ€™s identity. Finally, the prototype showcased an interactive version of the website, demonstrating the navigation and user experience to provide a clear vision of the final product."
